# Multimodal Fallacy Classification in Political Debates

This repository contains the code and resources for the project "Multimodal Argument Mining: A Case Study in Political Debates," focusing on the exploration of audio's role in classifying argumentative fallacies in political debates.

## Dataset: MM-USED-fallacies

The repository includes the code required to generate the MM-USED-fallacies dataset. This dataset is created by leveraging resources from the [MM-USED](https://github.com/federicoruggeri/multimodal-am/tree/main/multimodal-dataset) dataset and the [USED-fallacy](https://github.com/pierpaologoffredo/IJCAI2022) dataset. By incorporating multimodal techniques, we aim to enrich the fallacy analysis beyond traditional text-based information, specifically by incorporating audio data from political debates.

## Repository Structure

The main directory includes the following subdirectories:

- `local_database/`: This directory contains the original datasets USED-fallacy and MM-DatasetFallacies. It includes three versions of the MM-DatasetFallacies dataset: `full`, `no_duplicates`, and `partial-used` (for debugging purposes).
- `resources/`: This directory contains additional resources for the experiments.
  - `clips_generation/`: This subdirectory contains the files necessary to generate audio clips corresponding to dialogues, snippets, and components.
  - `download/`: This subdirectory contains the files necessary to download the recordings used in the experiments.
- `results/`: This directory stores the results of the experiments.
- `runnables/`: This directory houses the scripts necessary to run the experiments.
- `utils/`: This directory contains utility files for the experiments.

Please refer to the specific directories for further details on their contents and usage.

## Usage

1. Dataset Generation:
   - To generate the MM-USED-fallacy dataset starting from MM-USED and USED-fallacy, follow the following steps. The code and resources necessary for the dataset generation are included. Please, note that the file containing all the annotations for the MM-USED-fallacy dataset is already included in the `local_database/MM-DatasetFallacies/full` directory under the name `dataset.csv`.
     - Download the recordings of the debates using the information provided in the `experiments/resources/download/download_links.csv` file. The recordings should saved under `resources/debates_audio_recordings`. Please, use whatever tool you prefer to obtain the recordings.
     - Run the `run_clips_generation.sh` script in the `runnables` directory create the audio clips corresponding to the dialogues, snippets, and components. The script will generate the MM-USED-fallacy dataset clips and store them under a new folder `local_database/MM-DatasetFallacies/audio_clips`.
     
2. Experiments:
   - To run the experiments in the paper and perform leave-one-debate-out cross-validation:
     - Open the script `runnables/leave_one_out.py` and set:
       - **_text_model_**: can have values _bert_, _roberta_, _sbert_
       - **_audio model_**: can have values _wav2vec_, _clap_
       - **_config_**: can have values _text_only_, _audio_only_, _text_audio_
     - Run the `run_leave_one_out.sh` script in the `runnables` directory. The script will run the experiments for each debate and store the results in the `results` directory.
